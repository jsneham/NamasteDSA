/*
Time Complexity
it is used to measure efficiency of algorithm in terms of speed, as the input size grows

Big O Notation
It is nothing; just a symbol used to represent the worst-case complexity.

1. O(n) - Linear search
2. O(log n) - Binary Search    log n means we  are dividing n/2 till it becomes 1
3. O(n^2) - Nested Loop
4. O(n log n) - Merge Sort like for loop withing that for loop having binary search means n is decresing
5. O(n^3) – Triple Nested Loops
6. O(2^n) -  Recursive Fibonacci
7. O(n!)- Permutation generator
8. O(1) – Constant time (find a element at specific index)

What is Space Complexity?
Space complexity refers to how much extra memory an algorithm uses.
Examples:
Access 5th element: O(1)
Find max with variable: O(1)
New array: O(n)
2D Matrix: O(n^2)
