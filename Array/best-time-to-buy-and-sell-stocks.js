/* 

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 – 1 = 5.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints
1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104
Approach 1 (Brute Force)
Initialize maxProfit = 0.

Use two nested loops:

Outer loop picks a day i to buy the stock.
Inner loop picks a day j > i to sell the stock.
For every pair (i, j), calculate the profit: prices[j] - prices[i].
If this profit is greater than maxProfit, update maxProfit.
Return maxProfit after all iterations.

Dry Run

  Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
  
  i = 0, prices[i] = 7
     j = 1 → 1 - 7 = -6 → maxProfit = 0
     j = 2 → 5 - 7 = -2 → maxProfit = 0
     j = 3 → 3 - 7 = -4 → maxProfit = 0
     j = 4 → 6 - 7 = -1 → maxProfit = 0
     j = 5 → 4 - 7 = -3 → maxProfit = 0
  
  i = 1, prices[i] = 1
     j = 2 → 5 - 1 = 4 → maxProfit = 4
     j = 3 → 3 - 1 = 2 → maxProfit = 4
     j = 4 → 6 - 1 = 5 → maxProfit = 5
     j = 5 → 4 - 1 = 3 → maxProfit = 5
  
  i = 2, prices[i] = 5
     j = 3 → 3 - 5 = -2 → maxProfit = 5
     j = 4 → 6 - 5 = 1 → maxProfit = 5
     j = 5 → 4 - 5 = -1 → maxProfit = 5
  
  ... and so on.
  
  Final maxProfit = 5 (buy at 1, sell at 6)
    
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Two nested loops. For every element i, check all j > i. Total comparisons = n(n-1)/2 → O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
No extra data structures used. Only uses a variable maxProfit.
